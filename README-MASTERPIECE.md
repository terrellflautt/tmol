---

## 🚨 Known Limitations

### Time-Based Items:
- **Moonlight Dew** requires midnight clicks (3 needed)
- **Alternative:** Could add debug mode

### API-Dependent Features:
- AI NPC dialogue needs OpenAI API key
- GitHub integration needs token
- **Fallback:** Preset dialogue still works great

### Performance Considerations:
- 54 scripts = ~2MB total (acceptable)
- First load may take 2-3 seconds
- Subsequent visits are instant (cached)

---

## 🎯 Troubleshooting

### If Errors Occur:

**1. Check Console (F12)**
```javascript
// Should see:
✓ Master Story Integration System loaded
✓ Crafting & Scavenger Hunt System loaded
✓ Skill Mastery & Progression System loaded
// etc...
```

**2. Common Fixes:**
```bash
# Clear cache
Ctrl + Shift + Delete

# Hard refresh
Ctrl + F5

# Check file paths
# All scripts should be relative to index.html
```

**3. Verify Files:**
```bash
# Check all exist:
ls -la *.js
ls -la js/features/*.js
ls -la assets/images/*.{png,jpg,webp}
```
