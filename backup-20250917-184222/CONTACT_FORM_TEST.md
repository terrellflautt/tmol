   - Try invalid email formats (test@, @test.com, etc.)
   - Try messages shorter than 10 characters
   - Should show appropriate error messages

### Production Testing (after deployment)

- `https://terrellflautt.com#contact`
- `https://www.terrellflautt.com#contact`

## Visual States

## Email Delivery

When the form is submitted successfully:

1. **Email sent to**: Your configured email addresses in Web3Forms dashboard
2. **Email format**: Contains all form data in a structured format
3. **Response time**: Immediate (Web3Forms processes in real-time)

## Form Accessibility

- **Keyboard navigation** fully supported
- **Screen reader compatible** with proper labels
- **Focus indicators** for all interactive elements
- **Error messages** are announced to screen readers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Form not submitting:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify internet connection
- Ensure Web3Forms service is accessible

**2. Validation errors:**
- Verify all required fields are filled
- Check email format is valid
- Ensure message is at least 10 characters

**3. Emails not received:**
- Check Web3Forms dashboard for submission logs
- Verify email configuration in Web3Forms
- Check spam/junk folders

### Debugging

Enable browser developer tools and check:
- **Console tab**: For JavaScript errors
- **Network tab**: For API request/response details
- **Form data**: Verify all fields are being sent correctly

## Production Deployment

After deploying with the SSL script:

1. **Test form on live site**
2. **Verify email delivery**
3. **Check Web3Forms dashboard** for submission logs
4. **Test from multiple devices** and browsers

## Security Notes

- **Access key is public** (this is normal for Web3Forms)
- **Honeypot field** is hidden from users but catches bots
- **HTTPS required** for production (handled by CloudFront SSL)
- **CORS enabled** by Web3Forms for browser submissions
